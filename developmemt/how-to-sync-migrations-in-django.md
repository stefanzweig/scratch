# How to sync the migration files in development with django?

There are several developers in my team. Our project is being developed with django framework. All the backend guys have their local development database and they manage their own database migration files. They do not commit the migration files to version control. This is quite good but some guy has the bad habbit not fix the migration problem of default value. Others have to fix the problem when they pull the model changes back.

How to handle this situation? Thanks.
